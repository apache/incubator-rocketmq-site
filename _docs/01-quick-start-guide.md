This quick start guide is a detailed instruction of setting up RocketMQ messaging system on a local machine and sending/receiving messages.

# Prerequisite

   The following softwares are assumed installed:
   1. 64bit OS, Linux/Unix/Mac is recommended;
   1. 64bit JDK 1.7+; 
   1. Maven 3.2.x
   1. Git 

# Clone & Build

```shell
  > git clone -b develop https://github.com/apache/incubator-rocketmq.git
  > cd incubator-rocketmq
  > mvn -Prelease-all -DskipTests clean install -U
  > cd distribution/target/apache-rocketmq
```

 
# Start Name Server

```shell
  > nohup sh bin/mqnamesrv &
  > tail -f ~/logs/rocketmqlogs/namesrv.log
  The Name Server boot success...
```  

# Start Broker

```shell 
  > nohup sh bin/mqbroker -n localhost:9876 &
  > tail -f ~/logs/rocketmqlogs/broker.log 
  The broker[%s, 172.30.30.233:10911] boot success...
```
  

# Send & Receive Messages

Before sending/receiving messages, we need to tell clients the location of name servers. RocketMQ provides multiple ways to achieve this. For simplicity, we use environment variable `NAMESRV_ADDR`

```shell
 > export NAMESRV_ADDR=localhost:9876
 > sh bin/tools.sh org.apache.rocketmq.example.quickstart.Producer
 SendResult [sendStatus=SEND_OK, msgId= ...

 > sh bin/tools.sh org.apache.rocketmq.example.quickstart.Consumer
 ConsumeMessageThread_%d Receive New Messages: [MessageExt...
```

# Shutdown Servers

```shell
> sh bin/mqshutdown broker
The mqbroker(36695) is running...
Send shutdown request to mqbroker(36695) OK

> sh bin/mqshutdown namesrv
The mqnamesrv(36664) is running...
Send shutdown request to mqnamesrv(36664) OK
```
